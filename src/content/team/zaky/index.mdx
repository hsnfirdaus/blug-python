I am passionate about technology and have a strong background in backend development, particularly with PHP and JavaScript. 
While I'm not as proficient in frontend development, I have enjoyed working with jQuery, a JavaScript library. 
In addition to my technical skills, I am also exploring photography, videography, and video editing.
