A person who loves technology. Loved using React, a JavaScript library with Typescript. Also, I have experience in the backend using PHP with Slim Framework. Using NodeJS with NestJS Framework is something that also I've experienced. Learning another programming language like GO is also interesting to me. Besides that, in the past, I'm also learning After Effects and Adobe Illustrator. Currently, Fedora Linux is what I'm using as my daily Operating System.
